# Random Investigators
I love tabletop games, and [Arkham Horror: The Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/) ranks as one of my favorites.

This is a simple app that utilizes the [ArkhamDB API](https://arkhamdb.com/api/) to fetch random investigator cards for the given number of players (1-4). The goal is to let pseudorandom numbers keep you from spending hours evaluating investigators and setting up for the game so you can spend more time actually *playing*.

## Deployed Application
This app is hosted on GitHub pages and can be viewed at:

## Broken Card Links
Please note that occasionally you'll encounter a broken card image. This occurs mainly with investigator cards that are not yet fully released but have already been spoilered. It takes ArkhamDB some time to get high-quality images added to their database when new expansions are announced.

I have filtered a few broken cards out as I came across them, but I haven't yet taken time to pull all investigator card data from the API to compile a complete list of broken images. (Also, broken images now should be working images later.)
